# Build Events-to-Business Actions Scenarios with SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure/AWS

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework)

This repository contains code samples and instructions for developing an extension application in SAP BTP. The sample application has been developed to help customers enable building event-driven applications in SAP BTP for business scenarios to integrate any type of events from systems/applications/platforms into the SAP ecosystem via SAP BTP. These applications can be developed leveraging the events-to-business actions framework which helps to configure actions that need to be taken in SAP LoB systems based on the events. 

In this tutorial, the events are received from Microsoft Azure IoT and AWS IOT Platform and the actions for these events are taken in SAP S/4HANA. You can use this application to further customize it for other systems as well.

**Inbound to SAP S/4HANA**

In this scenario, events generated by Microsoft Azure/AWS IoT platforms are sent to SAP BTP's eventing service. In this tutorial, we have shown the development and configuration for SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh. This can be achieved using Event Mesh capability of SAP Integration Suite as well. The Node.js extension application based on the events-to-business actions framework subscribes to the Event Mesh queue and executes the action that is required to be taken based on the event details configured.

> **Important Note** : Please be aware that this GitHub repository is still work in progress for improvements and additional scenarios. Make sure you're pulling the repository from time to time and redeploying it in SAP BTP.

## Scenario

The business scenario you will be implementing here is to integrate real-time events generated from Microsoft Azure IoT Platform/AWS IoT into SAP business processes to enrich the outcome of enterprise operations and facilitate rapid decision-making. The framework can be extended to any platform and any kind of event.

You can choose to configure and integrate events with any SAP LoB solution.

## Business Process Flow

In this event-driven scenario, based on the real-time status of the IoT Devices, actionable events are sent to SAP BTP to decide on the critical business actions to be taken in the SAP Enterprise Business systems based on business rules defined in the system.

1. Data from IoT Devices are sent to Microsoft Azure IoT Central/AWS IoT which includes all the streaming data from the devices.

2. Based on the rules in Microsoft Azure IoT/AWS IoT, the data is published to SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh in case of any actions that need attention. This is configured in IoT Rules in the IOT Platform. Similar decisions can be configured in other systems and applications as well.

3. SAP BTP acts as a consumer. Once the event details are received, the SAP BTP extension application which is configured with all necessary actions (For example, configuring the decisions in SAP Build Process Automation to decide on the action to be taken, executing the chain of actions that needs to be taken based on the event received, configure the OData API call to be executed etc) executes the respective chain of actions.

4. The extension application in SAP BTP executes the business actions in respective SAP Enterprise systems.

## Disclaimer

This project has been a proof of concept, including several limitations and prerequisites. The objective was to build a extension application for receiving and automating the actions in SAP S/4HANA. For this reason, the coding should not be seen as any recommendation for productive implementation. It fulfils the purpose and requirements of a proof of concept and is not intended for productive usage. It has been declared as pure proof of concept only to give the development teams ideas for solving potential challenges when integrating events from other platforms and SAP S/4HANA using SAP BTP. This can be extended to integrate with any other SAP LoB system as well.
