# Build Events-to-Business Actions Scenarios with SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework)

This repository contains code samples and instructions for developing an extension application in SAP BTP. The sample application has been developed in a partner collaboration to help customers integrate any type of events from systems into SAP ecosystem via SAP BTP. This application helps to configure  actions that needs to be taken in SAP LoB systems based on the events that is received in SAP Event Mesh. The application scenario you will develop leverages Event-To-Business actions framework (extension application). 

There are two scenarios described in this repository. In this tutorial, the events are received from Azure IoT Platform and the actions for these events are taken in SAP S/4HANA. You can use this application to further customize it for other systems as well.

1. Inbound to SAP S/4HANA

    In this scenario, Azure IoT Events are sent to SAP Event Mesh using the Data Export functionality in Azure IoT Central Application. The Node.js extension application subscribes to SAP Event Mesh queue and executes the action that is required to be taken based on the event details. In this case, SAP Event Mesh is used. 

2. Outbound from SAP S/4HANA

    In this scenario, any event that is triggerred from SAP S/4HANA is sent to SAP Event Grid. With the latest Beta Releease of SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Plan, event is propogated to Azure Event Grid with direct connectivity. As the Connecivity Plan is currently available for only SAP Event Mesh to Azure Event Grid flow, the event consumption from Azure Event Grid to outlook notification to the user is implemented.You can further extend this scenario to communicate back to device from the event info received from SAP S/4HANA. This is not covered in this tutorial.

> **Important Note** : Please be aware that this GitHub repository is still work in progress for improvements and additional scenarios. Make sure you're pulling the repository from time to time and redeploying it in SAP BTP.

## Scenario:
The business scenario you will be implementing here is to integrate real time events generated from Microsoft Azure IoT Platform into SAP business processes to enrich the outcome of enterprise operations and facilitate rapid decision making. In this use-case you will see how an IoT Event from Azure IoT Central is handled for performing business operations in SAP S/4HANA. The framework can be extended to any platform and to any kind of event.

The example configured here focuses on using Microsoft Azure IoT Central, SAP Event Mesh, SAP CAP, SAP Workflow Management integrating with SAP S/4HANA. You can choose to configure and integrate with any SAP LoB solutions which exposes business services as OData APIs.

## Business Process Flow 

In this event-driven scenario, based on the real-time status of the IoT Devices from Microsoft Azure IoT Central, actionable events are sent to SAP BTP to decide on the critical business actions to be taken in the SAP Enteprise Business systems based on business rules defined in the system.

1. Data from IoT Devices are sent to Microsoft Azure IoT Central.

2. Rules in Microsoft Azure IoT triggers an call to SAP Event Mesh in case of any actions which needs attention.

3. SAP Event Mesh receives the events.

4. Extension application is configured with all necessary actions (call SAP Business Rules to read the decision tables to decide on action to be taken, configure the OData API call to be executed , service call back to the device etc) to be taken.

5. Extension application executes the business actions.

6. For this sample application, Purchase Requisition is created in SAP S/4HANA. 

## Solution Architecture

The key services used from Microsoft Azure are the Azure IoT Central, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Communication Service, Azure Event Grid and Azure Active Directory.

The services used from SAP BTP are the Cloud Foundry Runtime, SAP Event Mesh, SAP Connectivity service, SAP Private Link service, SAP Workflow Management, SAP Event Mesh Connectivity Plan(Beta) and SAP Destination service. 

SAP Private Link service is used for connectivity between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA when both the systems are running on Microsoft Azure Infrastructure, you can use Private Link service in the case of AWS as well, in this tutorial you will find implementation steps for SAP BTP Private Link service and Microsoft Azure Private Link service. Alternatively you can use SAP Connectivity service and Cloud Connector for integration of SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA as well. 

![plot](./images/eventprocessingarch.png)

The following steps depicts the information flow across systems (in both the scenarios) 

(1) Event is triggered from Microsoft Azure and sent to SAP Event Mesh.

(2) Event-to-Business-Action framework(extension app) processor module's endpoint is subscribed to SAP Event Mesh, hence receives this event. 

(3) Event-to-Business-Action framework (extension app) processor module leverages the Business Rules capability of SAP Build Process Automation to derive business action (for example, Purchase Order Requisition creation in SAP S/4HANA system) based on certain characteristics of incoming event.

(4), (5), (6) (7) and (8) Event-to-Business-Action framework (extension app) processor module triggers the defined action in the SAP S/4HANA system by using the SAP Destination Service and SAP Private Link Service.  

For more information, see [Set Up Connectivity Between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Using SAP Private Link Service](./documentation/Scenario1-Inbound-to-SAPS4HANA/Step4b-Setup-SAPPrivateLinkService/README.md) page.

In case SAP S/4HANA is on-premise and private cloud (refer to Figure-2)â€“ communication with SAP S/4 HANA integrates via SAP Connectivity Service and Cloud Connector.

(9) and (10) SAP S/4HANA publishes event for Purchase Requisition creation is sent to Microsoft Azure Event Grid via SAP Event Mesh Connectivity Bridge for further processing by Microfost Azure applications.

For outbound from SAP S/4HANA scenario using SAP Event Mesh Connectivity Plan(Beta), see [Integrate Events Between SAP and Microsoft using SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Bridge Service](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-event-mesh-connectivity-bridge) page. You will find the detailed architecture and business scenario for SAP Event Mesh and Azure Event Grid direct connectivity.

## Disclaimer
This project has been a proof of concept, including several limitations and prerequisites. The objective was to build a extension application for receiving and automating the actions in SAP S/4HANA. For this reason, the coding should not be seen as any recommendation for productive implementation. It fulfils the purpose and requirements of a proof of concept and is not intended for productive usage. It has been declared as pure proof of concept only to give the development teams ideas for solving potential challenges when integrating events from other platforms and SAP S/4HANA using SAP BTP. This can be extended to integrate with any other SAP LoB system as well.
