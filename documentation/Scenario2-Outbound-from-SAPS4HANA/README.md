# Receiving events from SAP S/4HANA in Microsoft Azure Event Grid using SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Bridge Service

The scenario described in this tutorial is to send events from SAP S/4HANA to Azure Event Grid via SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Bridge Service. This service is currently in Beta stage and will be available as SAP BTP service soon.

Detailed step by step documentation for this scenario is available in the GitHub repository - [Integrate Events Between SAP and Microsoft using SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Bridge Service](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-event-mesh-connectivity-bridge).

This service is used to receive the events from SAP S/4HANA and publish it to SAP Event Mesh. SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Bridge service and Azure Event Grid are directly connected which allows the events to reach Microsoft Azure from SAP Event Mesh using this bi-directional seamless connectivity channel.
