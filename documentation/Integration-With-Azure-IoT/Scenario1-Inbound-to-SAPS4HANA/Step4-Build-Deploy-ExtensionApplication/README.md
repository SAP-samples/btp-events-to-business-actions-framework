## Build and Deploy the Extension Application

In this section, you will clone the codebase and deploy the extension application in SAP BTP. 

### 1. Clone the GitHub Repository
    

Access the [Events To Action Framework](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework/tree/advanced-event-mesh) GitHub repository to download the project.

### 2. Check the Prerequisites for Deployment

Ensure you have added the required entitlements as described in section **Step1-Setup-SAPBTP-Subaccount** page before deployment.

### 3. Deploy the Extension Application

Build and deploy the application. Run the following commands:

**Note**: Ensure you have Cloud MBT Build Tool. Refer [The Cloud MTA Build Tool (MBT)](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE/c2b99f19e9264c4d9ae9221b22f6f589/1412120094534a23b1a894bc498c2767.html) for more details.

1. Open the Cloud Foundry command line interface (cf CLI).

2. Navigate to the **action-management** directory.

    ```
    cd action-management
    ```
3. Fetch the dependencies.

    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Build action-management modules.

    ```
    npm run build
    ```
5. Log in to your subaccount in SAP BTP to deploy the extension application.
    Check your region and copy the API endpoint accordingly. For example, "https://api.cf.region.hana.ondemand.com"

    ```
    cf login -a `<CF API endpoint>`
    ```
6. Push the application to your subaccount.

    ```
    npm run deploy
    ```
7. You can also check the status of your applications in the SAP BTP cockpit. Copy the value of the extension application URL.
