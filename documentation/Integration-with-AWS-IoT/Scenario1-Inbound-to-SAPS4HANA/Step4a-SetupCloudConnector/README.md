## Connect SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Using Cloud Connector

Follow these steps to set up the Cloud Connector and the SAP Connectivity service to establish secured communication between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA. 

>Note: Choose this configuration if you have SAP S/4HANA on-premise/private cloud.If you have SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA running on Azure, then you can skip this step and proceed to [next step](../Step4b-Setup-SAPPrivateLinkService/README.md) to setup connectivity between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA using Private Link.

### 1. Download and Install the Cloud Connector

1. Download the Cloud Connector from [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud) for your operating system. If you don't have Java installed on the server, download and install it.

### 3. Create a Cloud to On-Premise Connection

To make the SAP S/4HANA system available to the services and application in SAP BTP, you need to create a mapping between the Cloud Connector and the SAP S/4HANA system.

1. Log in to the Cloud Connector Administration cockpit and choose the name of your subaccount in SAP BTP in the **Subaccount** field.

2. Choose **Cloud To On-Premise**. In the **ACCESS CONTROL** tab, in the **Mapping Virtual To Internal System** section, choose the **Add** icon to add a virtual host entry.

    1. In the **Back-end Type** dropdown menu, select **ABAP System**. Choose **Next**.

    2. In the **Protocol** dropdown menu, select **HTTPS**. Choose **Next**.

    3. In the **Internal Host** and **Internal Port** fields, enter the hostname or IP address of the SAP S/4HANA system and the corresponding ICM port. Choose **Next**.

    4. In the **Virtual Host** and **Virtual Port** fields, enter a hostname of your choice and the **443** port. The value for virtual port can be updated if required. Choose **Next**.

    5. In the **Principal Type** dropdown menu, select **X.509 Certificate (Strict Usage)**. Choose **Next**.

    6. In the **Host In Request Header** dropdown menu, select **Use Virtual Host**. Choose **Next**.

    7. Select the **Check Internal Host** checkbox and choose **Finish**.

3. Select the virtual host created in the previous step and in the **Resources** section, choose the **Add** icon.

    1. In the **URL Path** field, enter **/**.

    2. Select the **Active** field.

    3. In the **Access Policy** field, select the **Path and All Sub-Paths** radio button.

    4. Choose **Save**.
