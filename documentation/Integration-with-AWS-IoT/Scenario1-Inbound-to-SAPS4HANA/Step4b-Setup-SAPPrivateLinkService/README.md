## Set Up Connectivity Between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Using SAP Private Link Service

>Note: Choose this configuration if you have SAP BTP subaccount and SAP S/4HANA running on Azure. If you have already established the connectivity between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA using Cloud Connector then you can skip this step.

### Prerequisites
These are the prerequisities that you need to consider if you have SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA on Microsoft Azure. 

- SAP S/4HANA system running on Microsoft Azure

- SAP Private Link service
    - Required to connect SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure.

>Note: The SAP BTP Private Link service is currently available only for enterprise accounts in SAP BTP.

- Microsoft Azure Private Link service
    - Required to connect Microsoft Azure and SAP S/4HANA.


### 1. Set Up the SAP Private Link Service and Microsoft Azure Private Link Service 

To configure these services for the SAP S/4HANA system, follow the 
 [Enhance core ERP business processes with resilient applications on SAP BTP - SAP Private Link Service](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-build-resilient-apps/tree/extension-privatelink/tutorials/05-PrivateLink) tutorial and complete the steps until the **Prepare Extension Application** section.

### 2. Create Service Key for SAP Private Link Service Instance in Your Subaccount in SAP BTP
