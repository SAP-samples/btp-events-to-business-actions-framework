5. Configuring a **REST Delivery Point**
     Next, you must configure a queue and a REST delivery point on Message VPN.

     **a.** Click on **Open Broker Manager**.

     ![plot](./images/aem-openbrokermanager.png)

     **b.** The **Broker Manager** application loads. The next step is to create a queue, on the left pane click on **Queues**  

     ![plot](./images/aem-click-on-queue.png)

     **c.** Create a Queue by name **Q/rdp1/input**

     ![plot](./images/aem-create-queue.png)

     Enable both incoming and outgoing configuration and Click on **Apply** button.

     ![plot](./images/aem-queue2.png)    

     Queue successfully created

     ![plot](./images/aem-queue-created.png)    

     **d.** Add a **Topic Subscription** to the queue.

     Click on the queue created and then click on the **Subscriptions** Tab.

     Then click on **+ Subscription** to add a topic.

     ![plot](./images/aem-addtopicsubscription.png)

     In the **Create Subscription** screen, type in the topic name as **ppe/messages** and click **Create**

     ![plot](./images/aem-topic-name.png)    

     Topic Subscription successfully created. 

     ![plot](./images/aem-topic-created.png)

     **e.** Create a **REST Delivery Point** object

     On the left pane click on **Clients** and then Navigate to **REST** tab.

     ![plot](./images/aem-rest-client.png)

     Click on **+ REST Delivery Point** and Fill the **RDP Name** as **rdp1**

     ![plot](./images/aem-rdp-name.png)

     Configure the REST Delivery Point

     ![plot](./images/aem-rdp-config.png)  

     REST Delivery Point successfully created
     
     ![plot](./images/aem-rdp-created.png)  

     **f.**  Create a Queue Binding object

     Create a queue binding to the queue you created previously. This will tell the RDP where to fetch messages from. **Note:** that REST Delivery Points (RDPs) can be bound to multiple queues.

     Click on the **rdp1** created in the previous step. Click on **Queue Bindings** Tab.

     ![plot](./images/aem-queue-binding.png)

     Create a queue binding - **Q/rdp1/input**

     ![plot](./images/aem-queue-binding-name.png)

     Set the POST target where the requests would be sent - **/api/events**

     ![plot](./images/aem-binding-config.png)

     **Note:** that the RDP is down - it will automatically start up when a REST consumer makes a connection to the RDP.

     ![plot](./images/aem-binding-completed.png)

     **g.** Create a **REST Consumer** object.

     Navigate to **REST Consumers** Tab and click on **+ REST Conusmer**

     ![plot](./images/aem-rest-consumer.png)

     Fill in the **REST Consumer Name** as **rc1** 

     ![plot](./images/aem-consumer-name.png)

     Enable the **REST Consumer** and set HOST:PORT details of the message HTTP listener. 

     To Fill the **Host** , Navigate to the Cloud Foundary Space where the application is deployed and Click on **action-management-srv**.

     ![plot](./images/aem-consumer-host.png)

     Copy the link under **Application Routes**,. **Note:** Strip the **https://** before pasting the value in the **Host** field

     ![plot](./images/aem-consumer-host-link.png)

     Fill in the Value of **Port** as **443**

     Select **POST** as the **HTTP Method**.

     Enable the TLS.

     Keep **Outgoing Connection Count** value as **1**.

     Fill the **Max Response Wait Time (sec)** as **30**

     Populate **Connection Retry Delay (sec)** field with **300**

     From the drop down menu, choose **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials** as the **Authentication Scheme**.

     Next, Go to your **BTP subaccount** ,Navigate to **Services** > **Instances and Subscriptions** and under the **Instances** select **action-management-auth**.

     ![plot](./images/aem-consumer-oauth.png)

     Under the **Service Keys** the key named **action-management-auth-key** is already created. Click on the **View** Option to get the **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials**.  

     ![plot](./images/aem-consumer-oauth-key.png)

     Copy the **clientid**, **clientsecret** and **url**. Navigate back to the **REST Consumer** configuration and paste the values for **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste the **url** copied earlier in the **Token Endpoint URL** and appened **/oauth/token** at the end of the **url**. 
     Effective **Token Endpoint URL** is **url/oauth/token**.

     Fill the remaining fields as shown in the screenshot below.

     ![plot](./images/aem-consumer-config.png)  

     REST Consumer successfully created

     ![plot](./images/aem-consumer-created.png)  

     A final, configured **RDP settings** would look like this.
